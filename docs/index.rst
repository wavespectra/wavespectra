wavespectra
===========

Python library for wave spectra
-------------------------------

Wavespectra is an open source project for working with ocean wave spectral data.
The library is built on top of `xarray`_, leveraging from xarray's labelled
multi-dimensional arrays and making dealing with wave spectra simple and fast.

History
-------
Wavespectra started as an internal tool developed at `Metocean Solutions`_ by
Rafael Guedes, Tom Durrant and David Johnson. It was released as open source in April
2018 and received contribution from Jorge Perez. The project was transitioned into a fully
community developed project in July 2019, hosted at the `wavespectra`_ github organisation.

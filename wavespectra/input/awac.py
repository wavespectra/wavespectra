"""Reader for AWAC spectra from NMEA data

https://www.nortekgroup.com/

The spectra are reconstructed from the Fourier coefficients using the maximum entropy method to remove negative energy.
Normalization is applied per frequency to keep energy over directions identical to energy in non-directional spectrum
The 2D spectral data is scaled to the significant wave height (Hs) given in the wave parameters.

The time is returned as read from the timestamps. The time-zone depends on the configuration of the device and is not included in the output.

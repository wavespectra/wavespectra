    """Spectra partition methods.

    Methods:
        - ptm1: In PTM1, topographic partitions for which the percentage of wind-sea energy exceeds a
          defined fraction are aggregated and assigned to the wind-sea component (e.g., the first
          partition). The remaining partitions are assigned as swell components in order of
          decreasing wave height.
        - ptm2: PTM2 works in a similar way to PTM1 by identifying a primary wind sea (assigned as
          partition 0) and one or more swell components. In this method however all the swell
          partitions are checked for the influence of wind-sea with energy within spectral bins
          within the wind-sea range (as defined by a wave age criterion) removed and combined
          into a secondary wind-sea partition (assigned as partition 1). The remaining swell
          partitions are then assigned in order of decreasing wave height from partition 2 onwards.
          This implies PTM2 has an extra partition compared to PTM1.
        - ptm3: PTM3 does not classify the topographic partitions into wind-sea or swell - it simply orders them
          by wave height. This approach is useful for producing data for spectral reconstruction applications
          using a limited number of partitions, where the classification of the partition as wind-sea or
          swell is less important than the proportion of overall spectral energy each partition represents.
        - ptm4: PTM4 uses the wave age criterion derived from the local wind speed to split the spectrum in
          to a wind-sea and single swell partition. In this case  waves with a celerity greater
          than the directional component of the local wind speed are considered to be
          freely propogating swell (i.e. unforced by the wind). This is similar to the
          method commonly used to generate wind-sea and swell from the WAM model.
        - ptm5: PTM5 splits spectra into wind sea and swell based on a user defined static cutoff.
        - hp01: HP01 partitions the spectra and merges wind-sea components as in the PTM1 method, then it merges
          adjacent swells following the criteria outlined in Hanson and Phillips (2001) and Hanson et al. (2009).
        - bbox: BBOX partitions the spectra based on user-defined bounding boxes in frequency-direction space.
        - ptm1_track: Partition spectra using the PTM1 method and track the partitions using the evolution of
          peak frequency and peak direction in time.

        HP01 partitions the spectra and merges wind-sea components as in the PTM1
        method, then it merges adjacent swells following the criteria outlined in
        Hanson and Phillips (2001) and Hanson et al. (2009). This method can be useful
        when partitioning measured wave spectra which are typically noisy and may
        contain small, non-physical partitions. Please notice this method is still
        under development and may not work as expected.

        Args:
            - wspd (xr.DataArray): Wind speed DataArray.
            - wdir (xr.DataArray): Wind direction DataArray.

            - agefac (float): Age factor.
            - wscut (float): Wind sea fraction cutoff.

            - k (float): Spread factor in Hanson and Phillips (2001)'s eq 9.
            - angle_max (float): Maximum relative angle for combining partitions.
            - hs_min (float): Minimum Hs of swell partitions, smaller ones are always
              combined with closest ones regardless of other criteria being satisfied.
            - ihmax (int): Number of discrete spectral levels in WW3 Watershed code.
            - combine_extra_swells (bool): If True and the number of swells partitions
              from the Hanson and Phillips 2001 algorithm is greater than the requested
              number given in the `swells` argument, merge each extra swell with its
              closest neighbour until the requested number is achieved. If False, extra
              swells are ignored from the output.
            - wstype (int):
                - 0: Wind partition defined by all full partitions whose wind sea
                  fraction exceed wscut.
                - 1: Wind partition defined only by spectral bins falling within

                  other swell partitions falling witing wave age parabola.
